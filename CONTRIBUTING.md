# Contributing to openHAB Homebrew Tap

Want to hack on the openHAB Homebrew Tap? Awesome!
Here are instructions to get you started.
They are probably not perfect, please let us know if anything feels wrong or incomplete.

## Reporting Issues

Please report [Homebrew tap specific issues here](https://github.com/openhab/homebrew-openhab/issues).

## Build System

The Homebrew Formulae are built from our [Formula template](Template/openhab.rb) by our [Formula build script](Template/build).
This is done in GitHub Actions, and changes to Formulae are automatically committed to this repository.
CI also performs various checks on the Formulae, see [brew test-bot](https://docs.brew.sh/Manpage#test-bot-options-formula).

When developing on a Formula, we recommend modifying the Formula in place and verify the build locally.
Once everything is working, modify the template with your changes and run the build script from the repository root to verify templating is working as expected.

The following commands might be useful when developing Formulae:

- Audit a Formula file: `brew audit --strict --online $FORMULA_NAME`
- Audit & Auto-fix issues for a Formula file: `brew audit --strict --online --fix $FORMULA_NAME`

## Contribution Guidelines

### Pull requests are always welcome

We are always thrilled to receive pull requests and do our best to process them as fast as possible.
Not sure if that typo is worth a pull request? Do it! We will appreciate it.

If your pull request is not accepted on the first try, don't be discouraged!
If there's a problem with the implementation, hopefully you received feedback on what to improve.

### Discuss your design in the discussion forum

We recommend discussing your plans in [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/openhab/homebrew-openhab/issues) before starting to code â€” especially for more ambitious contributions.
This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give feedback on your design, and maybe point out if someone else is working on the same thing.

### Create issues...

Any significant improvement should be documented as [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/openhab/homebrew-openhab/issues?labels=enhancement&state=open) before anybody starts working on it.

### ...but check for existing issues first!

Please take a moment to check that an issue doesn't already exist documenting your bug report or improvement proposal.
If it does, it never hurts to add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too".
This will help prioritise the most common problems and requests.

### Conventions

Fork the repo and make changes on your fork in a feature branch:

- If it's a bug fix branch, name it XXX-something where XXX is the number of the issue
- If it's a feature branch, create an enhancement issue to announce your intentions and name it XXX-something where XXX is the number of the issue.

Update the documentation when creating or modifying features.
Test your documentation changes for clarity, concision, and correctness.

Write clean code.
Universally formatted code promotes ease of writing, reading, and maintenance.

Pull requests descriptions should be as clear as possible and include a reference to all the issues that they address.

Pull requests must not contain commits from other users or branches.

Commit messages must start with a capitalised and short summary (max. 50 chars) written in the imperative,
followed by an optional, more detailed explanatory text which is separated from the summary by an empty line.

Code review comments may be added to your pull request.
Discuss, then make the suggested modifications and push additional commits to your feature branch.
Be sure to post a comment after pushing.
The new commits will show up in the pull request automatically, but the reviewers will not be notified unless you comment.

Commits that fix or close an issue should include a reference like `Closes #XXX` or `Fixes #XXX`, which will automatically close the issue when merged.

### Merge Approval

openHAB maintainers use the [GitHub review feature](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-reviews/) to indicate acceptance.

### Sign your work

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the patch,
which certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch.
The rules are pretty simple:
If you can certify the below (from [developercertificate.org](https://developercertificate.org/)):

```text
Developer Certificate of Origin
Version 1.1

Copyright (C) 2004, 2006 The Linux Foundation and its contributors.
660 York Street, Suite 102,
San Francisco, CA 94110 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.


Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

... then you just add a line to every git commit message:

```text
Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe.smith@email.com>
```

using your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.) and an e-mail address under which you can be reached
(sorry, no GitHub no-reply e-mail addresses (such as `username@users.noreply.github.com`) or other non-reachable addresses are allowed).

Additionally, can also sign off commits automatically by adding the `-s` or `--signoff` parameter to your usual git commit commands.

If your commit contains code from others as well, please ensure that they certify the DCO as well and add them with an "Also-By" line to your commit message:

```text
Also-by: Ted Nerd <ted.nerd@email.com>
Also-by: Sue Walker <sue.walker@email.com>
Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe.smith@email.com>
```

#### Small Patch Exception

There are several exceptions to the signing requirement.
Currently, these are:

- Your patch fixes spelling or grammar errors.
- Your patch is a single line change to documentation.

### How can I become a maintainer?

- Step 1: learn the component inside out
- Step 2: make yourself useful by contributing code, bugfixes, support, etc.
- Step 3: get nominated by an existing maintainer

Remember: being a maintainer is a time investment.
Make sure you will have time to make yourself available.
You don't have to be a maintainer to make a difference on the project!
